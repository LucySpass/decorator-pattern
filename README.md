# Hello, friends!

This one-file-project implements decoration pattern on python. I really liked the explanation of this pattern in :book: "Head First Design Patterns A Brain-Friendly Guide" book By Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra, Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, so that's from the idea originates.

#### Thank you for your interest and have a nice day
